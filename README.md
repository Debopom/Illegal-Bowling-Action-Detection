# ðŸš€ Deep Learning-Based Illegal Bowling Action Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository provides a deep learning-based solution for detecting illegal bowling actions in cricket using computer vision techniques. The system identifies illegal bowling actions by analyzing the arm's angle difference between two key frames in a bowler's delivery: **the shoulder frame** and **the release frame**. If the angle difference exceeds a predefined threshold (15 degrees), the action is flagged as illegal.

## ðŸš€ Features

âœ… **Pose Estimation using MediaPipe**  
âœ… **Object Detection with YOLOv8 for release frame extraction**  
âœ… **Video Processing from multiple angles (front, back, and side)**  
âœ… **High Accuracy: 91.96% accuracy and 100% true positive rate**  
âœ… **Real-time Detection suitable for live cricket matches**  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

ðŸ“Œ **62 videos featuring 11 male bowlers**  
ðŸ“Œ **Footage includes both legal and illegal bowling actions**  
ðŸ“Œ **Labeled dataset used for training and validation**  

## ðŸ“– Methodology

### ðŸ”¹ Dataset Collection & Preprocessing
Videos are labeled based on **ICC bowling rules**.

### ðŸ”¹ Frame Extraction
ðŸ“Œ **Shoulder Frame Extraction**: Detects the arm closest to shoulder level (270Â° angle).  
ðŸ“Œ **Release Frame Extraction**: Uses YOLOv8 to detect when the bowler releases the ball.  

### ðŸ”¹ Bowling Action Analysis
ðŸ“Œ Measures **elbow flexion** using **MediaPipe**.  
ðŸ“Œ If the angle difference exceeds **15Â°**, the delivery is flagged as **illegal**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Model Evaluation
ðŸ“Œ Tested with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
ðŸ“Œ Compared different models (**CNN, YOLOv7, YOLOv8**) for optimal performance.
